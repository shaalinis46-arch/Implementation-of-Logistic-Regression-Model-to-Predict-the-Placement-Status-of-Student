# Suppose we have: CGPA, Aptitude Score, Communication Skill → Placement (1=Placed, 0=Not Placed)
data = {
    'CGPA': [8.5, 6.8, 7.9, 5.4, 9.1, 8.0, 7.5, 6.0, 9.3, 5.8],
    'Aptitude_Score': [82, 55, 75, 48, 92, 77, 73, 50, 95, 45],
    'Communication_Skill': [8, 6, 7, 5, 9, 8, 7, 6, 9, 5],
    'Placed': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Dataset:\n", df, "\n")

X = df[['CGPA', 'Aptitude_Score', 'Communication_Skill']]
y = df['Placed']


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)


model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)


print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))


new_student = np.array([[8.2, 78, 8]])  # CGPA, Aptitude, Communication
prediction = model.predict(new_student)

print("\nNew Student Prediction:")
if prediction[0] == 1:
    print(" The student is likely to be PLACED.")
else:
    print(" The student is NOT likely to be placed.")
```
